## 🚧 Problem Statement

Managing cargo aboard the **International Space Station (ISS)** is a highly complex and manual task. Astronauts currently spend **~25% of their mission time** on stowage operations — storing, retrieving, and organizing items.

### 🔴 Key Challenges:

- ⏱️ **Wasted Time**: Reduces availability for research and maintenance  
- ❗ **Slow Retrieval**: Critical items may be hard to locate during emergencies  
- 📦 **Poor Space Utilization**: Limited volume leads to inefficient storage patterns  

---

## 💡 Our Solution

An **Intelligent Stowage Advisor** powered by AI/ML and smart heuristics to:

✅ Automate cargo placement, retrieval, and rearrangement  
✅ Streamline waste and return logistics  
✅ Save astronaut time and improve ISS operational efficiency
